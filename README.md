Hi there! I'm Somraj Saha, you can also call me Jarmos(_flip my first name_ :wink:) & I'm an independent consultant specializing in Machine Learning(ML) & Computer Vision(CV) applications. So suffice to say, I often get asked on various platforms about ML, in general. It becomes cumbersome when I've to give the same answer again & again to different individuals, which is why I created this repository to "_store_" all your questions & my answers for future reference.

But not sure what to ask me?

Well you could discuss anything ranging from **Machine Learning**, **Software Development** & other related technical stuff to anything between **Animes**, **movies**, **books**, etc. Oh if you're not interested in any of those either, just ask me about **Economics**. I've a Masters in Economics but taught myself to code & got into the field of ML applications.
